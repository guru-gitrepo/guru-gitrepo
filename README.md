### 🚀 What I’m Working On
- **LDO Regulator**: Currently implementing a Low-Dropout Regulator targeted for **TinyTapeout** fabrication.
- **PDK Exploration**: Deep-diving into **Skywater 130** characterization and layout constraints.
- **Open-Source EDA**: Mastering the workflow between **Xschem** (schematic), **Ngspice** (simulation), and **Magic VLSI** (layout).

### 🛠 Tech Stack & Tools
- **Design & Sim:** Xschem, Ngspice
- **Physical Design:** Magic VLSI, Netgen (LVS)
- **Hardware:** Skywater 130nm, TinyTapeout
- **Languages:** Spice, Verilog, Nutmeg (Scripting), Bash-shell
